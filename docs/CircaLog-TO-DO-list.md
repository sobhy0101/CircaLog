## 🧠 PHASE 0.5 — Circadian Engine

> The mathematical core of CircaLog. All downstream features (history,
> actogram, insights, exports, sync) depend on these pure functions
> producing consistent results. Build and test this layer **before**
> finalizing the IndexedDB schema — otherwise migrations have to be
> rewritten later.
>
> *This phase was independently recommended by three AI reviewers (Gemini,
> ChatGPT, Grok) in May 2026, each arriving at the same conclusion: the
> circadian logic is the product — the UI is secondary. Their full reviews
> are archived in `docs/archive/reviews/` and serve as the rationale if
> this architecture is ever questioned by a collaborator or clinician.*

### 📐 Foundational Decisions (decide before writing code)

- [x] 🔴 Decide and document timezone strategy
       (UTC timestamps + IANA timezone name per entry; field names: sleepStartUtc,
       wakeUtc, ianaTimezone; rationale and full decision in docs/timezone-strategy.md)
- [x] 🔴 Decide and document cycle-number storage strategy
       (store but treat as derived; gapless 1-based sequence; re-assign after every
       insert, back-fill, delete, and start-time edit; full decision in
       docs/cycle-number-strategy.md)
- [x] 🔴 Define TypeScript interfaces for the domain model
       (SleepEntry, Cycle, SessionType, QualityRating, InterruptionType,
       MedicationTiming, Interruption, Medication, FreeRunningPeriodResult,
       DriftResult, RollingAverages — all in src/lib/circadian/types.ts)

### 🧪 Test Infrastructure

- [x] 🔴 Install and configure Vitest
- [x] 🔴 Build test fixtures in `src/lib/circadian/__fixtures__/`
       - Sanitized historical sleep data from Mahmoud's own records
         (the strongest real-world test corpus available — supersedes any synthetic data)
       - Synthetic edge cases: timezone switches, DST transitions, long awake periods,
         back-fill scenarios, fragmented nights, nap-into-main-sleep drift

### 🔧 Pure Utility Functions (all in `src/lib/circadian/`)

- [x] 🔴 `normalizeSleepSpan(entry)` — overnight + timezone + DST normalization
- [x] 🔴 `detectSessionType(durationMs, gapMs)` — returns `'main'` | `'nap'`
- [x] 🔴 `assignCycleNumber(entries)` — assigns/recomputes cycle numbers (idempotent; runs after every back-fill)
- [x] 🔴 `calculateDrift(entries)` — minutes-per-cycle drift rate
- [x] 🔴 `estimateFreeRunningPeriod(entries)` — linear regression on sleep onset times; returns `'pending'` until 14+ entries
- [x] 🔴 `groupEntriesByCycle(entries)` — grouping helper for chart and history rendering
- [x] 🔴 `detectFragmentation(entry)` — flags fragmented sleep sessions
- [x] 🔴 `calculateRollingAverages(entries, windowDays)` — rolling 7/30-day stats

### ✅ Verification

- [x] 🔴 Vitest test suite passes against both fixture sets (real history + synthetic edge cases)
       with zero failures before Phase 0.5 is considered complete

## 🚀 V1 — Core MVP

### 🌐 Routing

- [x] 🔴 Set up React Router
- [x] 🔴 Create route: `/log` → main PWA app
- [x] 🔴 Create route: `/` → coming soon landing page

### 🎨 Design System

- [x] 🟢 Define CSS variables / Tailwind theme tokens
       (circa-bg/surface/surface-raised, circa-border/border-strong,
       circa-accent/accent-subtle/accent-light, circa-text-primary/secondary/muted —
       dark + light mode, @variant dark, FOUC script, ComingSoon.tsx migrated)
- [x] 🟢 Integrate Google Fonts — Exo 2 (variable weight) and Inter (variable):
       - Added preconnect hints to `index.html` (fonts.googleapis.com + fonts.gstatic.com)
       - Added `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags in `index.html` for both fonts (full variable axis, display=swap)
       - Defined `--font-family-display` and `--font-family-body` tokens in `@theme inline` in `index.css`
       - Note: used `<link>` in HTML instead of CSS `@import` — parallel loading, not render-blocking
       - Weight pruning deferred to performance pass (full axis loaded until UI is designed)
       (Fonts decided — see `docs/CircaLog_DevPlan_QA.md` → Typography section)
- [x] 🟢 Build dark/light mode toggle
       (useTheme hook with THEME_KEY export, ThemeToggle component with SVG icons,
       mounted temporarily in AppShell.tsx; FOUC comment updated to reference THEME_KEY)
- [x] 🟢 Design app logo / splash screen
       (Brand logo SVG + PWA icons already generated under `public/images/brand/`.
       Remaining: review splash screen coverage on Android; design branded splash if needed.)

### 🌐 Landing Page (circalog.app root)

- [x] 🟢 Design and build coming soon page
- [x] 🟢 App name + tagline
- [x] 🟢 "Get notified at launch" email capture (optional, simple)

### 🏠 App Shell & Navigation

- [x] 🟡 Build base app shell (bottom tab bar + side drawer layout)
- [x] 🟡 Build bottom tab bar: `[ Log ] [ Chart ] [ History ] [ Insights ]`
- [x] 🟡 Add bottom padding for Android/iOS system navigation bars
- [x] 🟡 Build side drawer (hamburger icon top-left)
- [x] 🟡 Populate drawer links: Settings, Reports, Export, About,
       Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, Dark Mode Toggle
       (move `ThemeToggle` here from its temporary placement in `AppShell.tsx`)

### 🛏️ Sleep Log — Core

- [x] 🔴 Design sleep log data model (IndexedDB schema)
       (Derives from Phase 0.5 TypeScript interfaces — do not finalize
       until the Circadian Engine is stable)
- [x] 🔴 Build IndexedDB service with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) from day 1
       (Edit/delete capability must exist before serious testing — junk test data
       accumulates otherwise. Consider Dexie.js once Phase 0.5 query patterns are
       clear; defer that decision until then.)
- [x] 🔴 Build manual time entry form (both start and wake)
       (Manual entry first — it stress-tests the data model faster than the timer
       flow and unblocks back-fill of historical data)
- [x] 🔴 Build "Start Sleep" one-tap timer screen
- [x] 🔴 Build "Wake Up" completion screen
- [x] 🟡 Required fields: sleep start, wake time, quality rating (1–5)
- [x] 🟡 Optional fields toggle:
       - Notes (free text)
       - Dreams / Nightmares (yes/no + text)
       - Interruptions (count + type: bathroom/thirst/hunger/pain/other)
       - Medication taken (before/during/after, yes/no)
- [x] 🟡 Wire `detectSessionType` from Phase 0.5 into the save path (Main Sleep ≥3h vs. Nap <3h)
- [x] 🟡 Wire `assignCycleNumber` from Phase 0.5 into the save path
- [x] 🟡 Display both calendar date AND cycle number on each entry
       (Shown on every History View entry card: cycle badge + local date + local times)
- [x] 🟢 Back-fill past entries (date/time picker for historical input)
       (Re-runs `assignCycleNumber` across the affected range after insert)
- [x] 🟢 Edit existing sleep entries — user-facing form (CRUD layer already exists from above)
       (ManualEntryForm in edit mode, pre-fills all fields from existing SleepEntry)
- [x] 🟢 Delete sleep entries — confirmation dialog UX (CRUD layer already exists from above)
       (Soft delete via DeleteConfirmDialog; cycle numbers renumber automatically)

### 📋 History View

> Built **before** the actogram — it is the debugging console for the
> sleep log data. Chart bugs become tractable when the raw entries are
> visible in a sortable, filterable list.
>
> *Note: the first two items below were completed as part of Batch C
> (Sleep Log Core), not a separate Batch D session. CC built the History
> View alongside Edit/Delete rather than deferring it.*

- [x] 🔴 List view of all past sleep entries
- [x] 🔴 Show: cycle number, calendar date, start time, wake time,
       duration, quality rating, session type (sleep/nap)
- [x] 🟡 Filter by: session type (All / Main Sleep / Nap) and quality rating (All / ★–★★★★★)
       (Collapsible filter panel opened via header icon button; dot indicator when
       active; "N of M sessions" subtitle; "Clear" button resets filters.
       Note: date range filter deferred — not included in V1 build.)
- [x] 🟢 Sort by: Newest (default) / Oldest / Rating ↑ / Rating ↓
       (Compact button row always visible above the entry list)

### 📊 Visualization — Actogram

- [x] 🔴 Build actogram component using Recharts
       - Y axis: time of day (00:00 – 23:59, or extended for >24h sessions)
       - X axis: cycle number (primary) + calendar date (secondary)
       - Sleep blocks rendered as vertical bars/bands
       - Nap blocks visually distinct from main sleep (opacity or color)
- [x] 🔴 Build time range toggle: `[ 1W ] [ 1M ] [ 3M ] [ 6M ] [ 1Y ] [ All ]`
       - Default: 1W
       - Toggling changes visible range only — no data is hidden
- [x] 🟡 Tooltip on hover/tap showing session details
       (Part of the core build — the chart is unreadable on mobile without it)
- [x] 🟡 Basic touch navigation: horizontal pan/swipe
       (Part of the core build — required for mobile readability)
- [x] 🟡 Render actogram in dark and light themes correctly
- [x] 🟡 Handle empty state (no data yet — prompt to log first sleep)
- [ ] 🟢 Pinch-to-zoom (V2 candidate; basic pan is sufficient for V1)

### 🔐 Auth & Cloud Sync

> Moved into V1 so that real patient data can be imported and used safely.
> IndexedDB alone is not sufficient — it can be evicted by the browser at
> any time, and the patient's PC is unstable. Data must land in Supabase
> immediately on import. Nothing in this section should be built after the
> CSV import below.

- [x] 🔴 Implement optional Google Sign-In (Required for data resilience)
- [x] 🔴 Connect Supabase auth to Google OAuth
- [x] 🟢 Show sign-in success toast notification
- [x] 🟢 Show signed-out toast notification
- [x] 🟢 Show error toast notification (sign-in / sign-out failures)
- [x] 🔴 Build sync service: IndexedDB → Supabase on connect
- [x] 🟡 Handle sync conflicts (local wins by default)
- [x] 🟡 Show sync status indicator in UI
- [x] 🟢 Allow sign-out (data remains local)

### 📥 Data Import

- [ ] 🟡 Import sleep log from CSV
       - Accepts CSV exported from the CircaLog Daily Tracker spreadsheet
         (`C:\Users\sobhy\OneDrive\CircaLog-Daily-Tracker.xlsx`)
       - Column mapping: Date, Bed Time, Sleep Start, Wake Time, Quality,
         Notes, Had Dreams, Interruptions
       - Preview table before confirming import
       - Skips duplicate entries (matched by sleepStartUtc)
       - Requires active Google Sign-In and Supabase sync before import
         is permitted — data must land in Supabase immediately, not only
         in local IndexedDB
       - Runs `assignCycleNumber` across all entries after import completes

### 💡 Insights View

- [ ] 🟡 Average sleep duration (rolling 7-day and 30-day)
- [ ] 🟡 Average drift per cycle (how many minutes later per cycle)
- [ ] 🟡 Longest and shortest sleep sessions
- [ ] 🟡 Total sleep sessions logged
- [ ] 🟡 Current streak (consecutive days with at least one log)
- [ ] 🟢 Free-running period estimate
       - Requires minimum 14 days of data
       - Calculated via linear regression on sleep onset times
       - Show "Pending — log 14+ days to unlock" until threshold is met
       - Display prominently once available

### 🔧 PWA & Deployment

- [x] 🔴 Configure Vite PWA plugin (Workbox service worker)
- [x] 🔴 Silent auto-update on new deployments
- [ ] 🟡 Verify PWA icons are wired into the manifest (all sizes for Android, iOS, PWA)
       (Icons already generated under `public/images/brand/` — this is configuration verification)
- [ ] 🟡 Verify Android splash screen coverage; design branded splash if needed
- [ ] 🟡 App installable on Android (add to home screen — verify after icons are wired)
- [ ] 🟢 Offline fallback page
- [ ] 🟢 In-app changelog modal — show on first load after update
       (UX polish, not a blocker for V1 functionality)

### 🛟 Data Resilience

> IndexedDB can be evicted by browser storage cleanup. Export/import is
> the safety net before cloud sync arrives in V2 — for a tool tracking
> months or years of personal health data, this is not optional.

- [ ] 🔴 Export all data as JSON (manual backup)
- [ ] 🔴 Import JSON backup (manual restore, with merge-vs-replace prompt)
- [ ] 🟡 Schema migration handler (for when the engine model evolves)

### ☕ Drinks Log

> Caffeine timing is medically relevant to sleep onset — a coffee at 3 PM
> still has half its stimulant effect at 8–10 PM due to caffeine's ~5–7 hour
> half-life. For Non-24 patients fighting delayed sleep timing, and for any
> patient whose doctor needs accurate context, this is signal, not noise.
>
> Alcohol affects sleep architecture. Protein shakes affect satiety and
> indirectly sleep quality. Juice can carry sugar load and sometimes caffeine.
> Water intake is relevant for hydration and, for patients with conditions
> affecting nocturia (e.g. enlarged prostate), can correlate with sleep
> fragmentation patterns.
>
> The goal is to give a sleep specialist a complete picture — not just the
> sleep log, but the context surrounding it.

- [ ] Drinks log — data model (`DrinkLogEntry` in `src/lib/circadian/types.ts`)
       - Date (DD/MM/YYYY)
       - Time (HH:MM)
       - Drink type: Coffee / Tea / Energy Drink / Protein Shake / Juice /
         Alcohol / Water / Other
       - Caffeine estimate: auto-calculated from drink type; manual override
         available
       - Size: Small / Regular / Large / Custom (oz and ml input)
- [ ] Settings — Caffeine reference table
       (default mg values per drink type per size; user-editable)
- [ ] IndexedDB store: `drink_log_entries`
- [ ] Supabase table: `drink_log_entries`
- [ ] Quick-entry UX for water (high logging frequency — needs low friction)
- [ ] Insights — caffeine curve overlay
       - Optional overlay on the actogram or timeline view
       - Shows estimated active caffeine level across the day
       - Calculated from logged drinks using standard ~5–7 hour half-life model
- [ ] Doctor report integration (V2 reports task)
       - Include caffeine intake summary in the one-tap PDF
       - Correlate drink timing with sleep onset latency where data permits

### 💊 Medication & Meal Log

> Designed around the Non-24 reality: clock-based medication schedules
> break when your sleep cycle rotates. A patient who wakes at 5 PM has
> already missed two anchor points and must reason about food gaps, sleep
> gaps, and the next valid window simultaneously.
>
> The model uses four linked tables/stores: a one-time-configured
> **medication library** and **meal library**, plus a daily
> **dose log** and **meal log**. On the logging screen the user taps
> from a pre-populated list — no typing drug names on a phone.
>
> Full TypeScript types are in `src/lib/circadian/types.ts`:
> `MedicationDefinition`, `MealDefinition`, `DoseLogEntry`, `MealLogEntry`.
> Supabase tables and IndexedDB stores share the same four names.

- [ ] Settings — Medication Library screen
       - Add / edit / deactivate medications
       - Fields: name, scheduled times (multi-value HH:MM), window ± minutes
       - Food relationship: `with_food` | `after_food` | `before_food` | `independent`
       - Food gap (minutes before/after eating)
       - Min gap before sleep onset (minutes)
       - Missed-dose policy: `skip` | `take_late` | `ask`
       - `isActive` toggle (retire without losing history)
- [ ] Settings — Meal Library screen
       - Add / edit / deactivate meal slots (e.g. "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner")
       - Optional typical clock-time hint per slot (UI hint only — never used
         for compliance calculations because Non-24 makes fixed meal times
         irrelevant)
- [ ] Daily dose log — auto-generation
       - Create a `DoseLogEntry` row (status: `missed`) for every scheduled
         dose at the start of each day; update to `taken`/`skipped` on user
         action
       - This produces a compliance record, not just a list of taken doses
- [ ] Daily meal log — quick entry
       - User picks a `MealDefinition` from their library and records actual
         eat time; the engine uses this as the food anchor for dose
         compliance checks
- [ ] Logging screen integration
       - When waking, show a pre-populated list of today's due/overdue doses
       - Tap a medication → enter actual time taken (or mark skipped)
       - Optional free-text note per dose
       - Meal log entry accessible from the same screen
- [ ] Insights — compliance view
       - Taken / missed / skipped counts per medication over 7-day and 30-day
         windows
       - Highlight doses taken outside their food-gap rule (warning, not
         blocking)
       - Link dose compliance data to sleep quality correlation
- [ ] Doctor report integration (V2 reports task)
       - Include medication compliance summary in the one-tap PDF
       - Show which doses were missed, when, and against which scheduled time

### 😴 Sleep Debt Tracker

- [ ] User-configurable sleep target (default: 8 hours)
- [ ] Display cumulative sleep debt / surplus
- [ ] Note in UI that Non-24 makes standard targets approximate
